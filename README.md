## Objectives

* You will create a functioning calculator in JavaScript, HTML, and LESS (CSS);

* You will be given the HTML and must style it to look like the template.

* Your calculator must be able to add, subtract, divide, and multiply two numbers.

* It should operate correctly with multidigit numbers.

* Your 'c' button must effectively clear the calculator so you can do another operation.

* You will need to register click listeners on all the buttons.

* As you click the numbers they should show up on the readout and then when you press '=' the result should be displayed in the container with the id 'readout'

* All the buttons should highlight.

## Extra Credit Requirements

* Your calculator should be able to do more than one opertion per statement, i.e. 10 + 5 - 2.

* Once your calculator completes an operation/statement, the next key entered should start a new operation.

* Your calculator should make sure its first input is a number (save for the '-' symbol).

* All inputs/results that are numbers should be displayd in the readout, and the result should be calculated as you move to the next operation e.g. if your operations were 1 + 2 + 4, when you press the second '+' the readout should show 3.

* Make the '.' operate correctly.

* Your calculator should evaluate this order of inputs correctly 5 + * 2 - 3 (the result should be 7, not 4, i.e. the '+' should be ignored).
